## Creating Your First Page

You create pages to document course materials from Liberty University's programs. Start with a simple note on Christian foundations in education.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Web Interface" icon="globe">

    Access the dashboard and click 'New Page' to begin.

    ````html
    <div class="new-page-btn">Create Page</div>
    ````

  </Tab>
  <Tab title="CLI" icon="terminal">

    Use command line for batch creation of multiple pages.

    ````bash
    wiki page create --title "Aviation Studies" --content "Notes on flight principles with biblical ethics."
    ````

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Organizing Content

Structure your wiki using folders and tags for efficient navigation. You categorize content by degree level, such as bachelor's in business or master's in law.

<Columns cols={2}>
  <Card title="Folders" icon="folder" href="#">
    Create hierarchical structures for program-specific notes.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Tags" icon="tag" href="#">
    Label pages for quick filtering across 700+ options.
  </Card>
</Columns>

<ExpandableGroup>
  <Expandable title="Folder Best Practices" default-open="true">

    Nest folders like 'Undergraduate/Medicine' for targeted access.

  </Expandable>
  <Expandable title="Tagging Strategy">

    Use tags like 'christian-worldview' for cross-referencing.

    ````javascript
    wiki.tag.add('page-id', ['liberty', 'education']);
    ````

  </Expandable>
</ExpandableGroup>

## Syncing and Backup

You sync your wiki across devices for on-campus and online access. Enable automatic backups to cloud storage integrated with Liberty's systems.

<CodeGroup tabs="Node.js,Python">
  ```javascript
  // Sync configuration
  await wiki.sync({
    remote: 'https://liberty-cloud.com',
    auth: { token: 'your-liberty-token' }
  });
  ```
  ```python
  # Sync using Python client
  wiki.sync(remote='https://liberty-cloud.com', auth={'token': 'your-liberty-token'})
  ```
</CodeGroup>

```mermaid

```

Troubleshoot sync issues by checking network connectivity. Restore from backups if needed during semester transitions. This ensures continuity in your academic documentation.

You now have a functional wiki ready for extensive use in your Liberty University journey.
